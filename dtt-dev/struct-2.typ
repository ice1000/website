== Introduction

The goal of this chapter is to revisit the structures defined in #cross-link("struct-1")[Structures I] with an eye on generalization.

== Structures, revisited

We start the section by a reflection on the definition of #cross-link("struct-1", reference: <def:rule:unit>)[having a unit type].
For a type theory to have a unit type, the following needs to be true:

For every context $Î“$,
+ there is a type $Î“ âŠ¢ top$,
+ there is a term $Î“ âŠ¢ â˜… : top$
  such that every term of this type is equal to it,
+ and this whole thing is preserved by substitution.

For product types, we can rephrase its definition in a similar way,
but with the presence of rule premises, they are more complicated:

For every context $Î“$ and types $Î“ âŠ¢ A$ and $Î“ âŠ¢ B$,
+ there is a type $Î“ âŠ¢ A Ã— B$,
+ for every pair of terms $Î“ âŠ¢ t : A$ and $Î“ âŠ¢ u : B$, there is a term $Î“ âŠ¢ âŸ¨t, uâŸ© : A Ã— B$
  such that every term of this type can be written as such a pair,
+ and this whole thing is preserved by substitution.

Note that the fact that all terms can be written as such a pair is known as all terms _factor through_ the introduction rule.
Similarly for the empty type, all terms in contexts where $bot$ is present _factor through_ the elimination rule.

There seems to be a lot of things in common:

For every context $Î“$ and types $Î“ âŠ¢ ðŸ¤”$,
+ there is a type $Î“ âŠ¢ âœ¨$,
+ for every tuple of terms $Î“ âŠ¢ ... : ðŸ¤”$, there is a term $Î“ âŠ¢ ... : âœ¨$
  such that every term of this type factor through its introduction,
+ and this whole thing is preserved by substitution.

Now, the real question arise: can we generalize this and how do we do that?

== Raw structures

We start by thinking about products.
Given any $Î“âŠ¢A$ and $Î“âŠ¢B$, we may rephrase the introduction of product $AÃ—B$ as having another type $Î“âŠ¢X$ with two _pseudo-projections_:
$ Î“,x:X âŠ¢ a: A #h(2em) Î“,x:X âŠ¢ b: B $
which gives me back the original $A$ and $B$.
This motivates the following definition.

// Cones for products
#definition("Raw product")[
Given any $Î“âŠ¢A$ and $Î“âŠ¢B$. A _raw product_ consists of the following data:
+ A type $Î“âŠ¢X$,
+ Two terms $Î“,x:X âŠ¢ a: A$ and $Î“,x:X âŠ¢ b: B$.
We denote a raw product as $(X, a, b)$.
]

Then, the product $AÃ—B$ is something we can always use these pieces of information to introduce an instance with, like this:
$ Î“,x:X âŠ¢ âŸ¨a,bâŸ© : AÃ—B $
Also note that the product $AÃ—B$ can also be used to make a "raw product", namely $(AÃ—B, x.1, x.2)$.
The special feature of this legitimate product is that it has an introduction rule that transforms any raw product into it.

Now, we can redefine the product without assuming its pre-existing rules.

#definition("Product")[
The product $(AÃ—B,x.1,x.2)$ is a raw product such that
for every other raw product $(X,a,b)$, there exists a _unique_ term, called the _constructor_:
$ Î“, x:X âŠ¢ h : AÃ—B $
such that:
$ Î“, x:X âŠ¢ a â‰¡ h.1 : A \
  Î“, x:X âŠ¢ b â‰¡ h.2 : B
  $
where $h.1$ is the result of the substitution $x.1 [h slash x]$, and similarly for $h.2$.
] <def:ct:product>
The idea is that constructing a term of type $AÃ—B$ must go through its introduction rule,

We can diagramize the conditions in @def:ct:product as a commutative diagram.
In context $Î“$, we have:
#align(center)[#diagram(cell-size: 15mm, $
  &X cedge("lb", a, ->)
     cedge("rb", b, ->)
     cedge("d", h, "-->")
   & \
  A &AÃ—B cedge("l", .1, ->)
      cedge("r", .2, ->)
  & B
$)]

This is rather like _characterizing_ the product type, instead of _defining_ it.

Now, it is tempting to define another type in a similar vibe.
We start by trying the unit type.

#definition("Raw unit")[
A _raw unit_ consists of the following data:
+ A type $Î“âŠ¢X$,
+ A term $Î“âŠ¢u: X$.
We denote a raw unit as $(X, u)$.
]

Then $(top, â˜…)$ is an instance of such a raw unit,
and we can characterize the unit type as follows:

#definition("Unit")[
The unit type is a raw unit such that
for every other raw unit $(X,u)$, there exists a _unique_ term, called the _constructor_:
$ Î“ âŠ¢ h : top $
such that:
$ Î“ âŠ¢ u â‰¡ h : top $
] <def:ct:unit>

It is clear that this coincides with the original definition of the unit type,
where $h$ is just another name for $â˜…$!

== Limit of Compilers

Now, we further generalize the idea of raw structures.
The data in a raw product in type theory $bold(A)$ can be represented as a _cone_,
which is defined below.

#definition("Schema of a product")[
Consider a dependent type theory $bold(D)$ with the following rules:
$ Â·âŠ¢A #h(2em) Â·âŠ¢B $
The _schema_ of a product in type theory $bold(A)$ is a compiler $bold(F) : bold(D) â†’ bold(A)$.
] <def:schema:product>
Essentially, a schema _chooses_ two types $Î“âŠ¢[| A |]_bold(F)$ and $Î“âŠ¢[| B |]_bold(F)$
in $bold(A)$ for the base context $Î“=[| Â· |]_bold(F)$.

#definition("Schema of a unit")[
The _schema_ of a unit in type theory $bold(A)$ is a compiler $bold(F) : bold(0) â†’ bold(A)$,
where $bold(0)$ is the empty type theory.
] <def:schema:unit>

#definition("Cone")[
A _cone_ of a schema $bold(F) : bold(D) â†’ bold(A)$ consists of the following data,
where we denote the base context as $Î“=[| Â· |]_bold(F)$:
+ A type $Î“âŠ¢X$,
+ for every type $Î”âŠ¢A$ in $bold(D)$,
  a substitution $Î“,x:X âŠ¢ a_A : [| Î”,A |]_bold(F)$,
+ such that the diagram of all $a_A$ and the terms interpreted by $bold(F)$ commutes.
We denote a cone as $Cone(bold(F), Î“âŠ¢X)$, and refer to the diagram mentioned above
as the diagram of this cone.
]
In the above two cases, $Î”$ is always $Â·$, so the substitution $a_A$ is really just a term.

A _cone_ of the schema in @def:schema:product corresponds to the following diagram:

#align(center)[#diagram(cell-size: 15mm, $
  [| A |] &X cedge("l", x.1, ->)
     cedge("r", x.2, ->)
   & [| B |]
  $)]
Since there is no directed paths that share the same source and target,
the diagram always commutes.
Usually, there will be some term in the image of $bold(F)$,
and in those cases, we will have a nontrivial commutative diagram.

A cone of the schema in @def:schema:unit is just a type $Î“âŠ¢X$.

With the notion of cones, we can define the notion of _limits_,
which should coincide to the original definition of the types (in our case, products and the unit type):

#definition("Limit")[
The _limit_ of the cones of a schema $bold(F) : bold(D) â†’ bold(A)$
is a cone $Cone(bold(F), Î“âŠ¢X)$ such that for every other cone
from the same context $Cone(bold(F), Î“âŠ¢A)$, there is a unique term:
$ Î“,x:A âŠ¢ h: X $
such that the diagram of both cones and $h$ commutes.
] <def:limit>

Now, let us take a look at products as the limit of the schema in @def:schema:product.
