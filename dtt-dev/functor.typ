= Introduction

The goal of this chapter is to defined well-typed translations between type theories, aka compilers.

Before talking about translations between type theories,
we first need to make it explicit that what data give rise to a type theory, and then we define how to translate between them.

= Conventions

We consider a type theory to be a #cross-link("subst")[substitution calculus] plus a set of postulated rules,
denoted using caligraphic letters or bold font words, e.g. $cal(A), cal(B)$, or $bold("TT")$.

In the presence of multiple type theories, we write $Î“ âŠ¢^cal(A) ...$ to mean that this judgment happens in type theory $cal(A)$.

Recall in #cross-link("struct-1")[last chapter] we have introduced a couple of _structures_ of type theories, defined to be having some data and the ability to derive some rules.
When postulating rules, we might just say "$cal(A)$ has #cross-link("struct-1", reference: <def_product>)[product type]" to say that we are postulating all the rules needed by product type in $cal(A)$.

The following are some example definitions of type theories:

#example[
- The empty type theory $bold(0)$ has the empty set of postulated rules.
- The unit type theory $bold(1)$ has a unit type.
- Alternatively, another unit type theory has a unit type and product types.
] <ex_empty_unit_fp>
#lemma[In the empty type theory, there is only one context -- the empty one.]
#lemma[In the unit type theory, all contexts except the empty one are isomorphic.]

= Translations

#definition("Compiler")[
A _compiler_ from type theory $cal(A)$ to type theory $cal(B)$, denoted $cal(F):cal(A) â†’ cal(B)$,
is a pair of functions, called _translations_, both denoted $[| - |]_cal(F)$,
where for input $A$, it produces output $[| A |]_cal(F)$:

- A mapping from types $Î“ âŠ¢^cal(A) A$ into the types in $cal(B)$, denoted $[| Î“ |]_cal(F) âŠ¢^cal(B) [| A |]_cal(F)$, where $[|Î“|]_cal(F)$ is iterated translation of types inside $Î“$,
- A mapping from terms $Î“ âŠ¢^cal(A) t : A$ into terms in $cal(B)$, denoted $[| Î“ |]_cal(F) âŠ¢^cal(B) [| t |]_cal(F) : [| A |]_cal(F)$;

such that:

- If $Î“ âŠ¢^cal(A) A â‰¡ B$ is derivable, then $[| Î“ |]_cal(F) âŠ¢^cal(B) [| A |]_cal(F) â‰¡ [| B |]_cal(F)$ is derivable,
- If $Î“ âŠ¢^cal(A) t â‰¡ u : A$ is derivable, then $[| Î“ |]_cal(F) âŠ¢^cal(B) [| t |]_cal(F) â‰¡ [| u |]_cal(F) : [| A |]_cal(F)$ is derivable.
] <def_compiler>

When there is only one compiler in the context, we might omit the subscript $cal(F)$.

Observe that presuppositions commute with compilations:

#align(center)[#diagram(cell-size: 15mm, $
  Î“ âŠ¢^cal(A) t: A
    edge("rr", #[presupposes])
    edge("d", [| - |], ->)
    && Î“ âŠ¢^cal(A) A
    edge("d", [| - |], ->) \
  [| Î“ |] âŠ¢^cal(B) [| t |] : [| A |]
    edge("rr", #[presupposes])
    && [| Î“ |] âŠ¢^cal(B) [| A |]
$)]

So, when translating the rules, we do not have to do additional work to ensure that the presuppositions are satisfied.

#example[
For every type theory $cal(A)$, there exists a compiler from $cal(A)$ to the unit type theory $bold(1)$ (@ex_empty_unit_fp), by compiling all types and terms as the unit type and its introduction rule.
]
#example[
For every type theory $cal(A)$, there exists a compiler from the empty type theory $bold(0)$ to $cal(A)$, because there is nothing to compile.
]

= Structures, revisited

We start the section by a reflection on the definition of #cross-link("struct-1", reference: <def_unit>)[having a unit type].
For a type theory to have a unit type, the following needs to be true:

For every context $Î“$,
+ there is a type $Î“ âŠ¢ top$,
+ there is a distinguished term $Î“ âŠ¢ â˜… : top$
  such that every term of this type is equal to it,
+ and this whole thing is preserved by substitution.

For product types, we can rephrase its definition in a similar way,
but with the presence of rule premises, they are more complicated:

For every context $Î“$ and types $Î“ âŠ¢ A$ and $Î“ âŠ¢ B$,
+ there is a type $Î“ âŠ¢ A Ã— B$,
+ for every pair of terms $Î“ âŠ¢ t : A$ and $Î“ âŠ¢ u : B$, there is a term $Î“ âŠ¢ âŸ¨t, uâŸ© : A Ã— B$
  such that every term of this type can be written as such a
  pair,
+ and this whole thing is preserved by substitution.

Note that the fact that all terms can be written as such a pair is known as all terms _factor through_ the introduction rule.
Similarly for the empty type, all terms in contexts where $mybot$ is present _factor through_ the elimination rule.

There seems to be a lot of things in common:

For every context $Î“$ and types $Î“ âŠ¢ ðŸ¤”$,
+ there is a type $Î“ âŠ¢ âœ¨$,
+ for every tuple of terms $Î“ âŠ¢ ... : ðŸ¤”$, there is a term $Î“ âŠ¢ ... : âœ¨$
  such that every term of this type factor through its introduction,
+ and this whole thing is preserved by substitution.


Can we generalize this?
