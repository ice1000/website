= Tesla (Yinsen) Zhang

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the #link("https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu")[Computer Science Department] at CMU,
advised by Professor #link("https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~balzers")[Stephanie Balzer].

My personal interests include implementing type checkers for dependent type theories,
making fancy programming language tools, programming language design,
and thinking about type theories from a category theoretical point of view.
