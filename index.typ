= Tesla (Yinsen) Zhang

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the #link("https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu")[Computer Science Department] at CMU,
advised by Professor #link("https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~balzers")[Stephanie Balzer], working on session type theories.

My personal interest includes implementing type checkers for dependent type theories,
making fancy programming language tools,
and thinking about type theories from a categorical point of view.
